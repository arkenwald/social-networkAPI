# Social Network API
Challenge 18

Description

This project is for self-improvement and practice in order to provide myself with confidence within this industry.

I wanted an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM was used.

Installation & Usage:

Clone the repository on github locally.

Install node modules through the command 'npm install'

Start the server using 'npm start' and open up insomnia

In Insomnia, navigate to http://localhost:3001/api/users to see all users. 

You can replace users with other end points to see their respective data.
